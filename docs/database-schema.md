# Database Schema Improvements

## Property Table Indexing

We've improved the database schema by adding indexes to optimize search performance, particularly for location-based queries which are common in property portals.

### Indexes Added

1. **Single-column indexes** for frequently queried fields:

   - `address_idx` on `address`
   - `city_idx` on `city`
   - `zip_code_idx` on `zip_code`
   - `price_idx` on `price`
   - `bedrooms_idx` on `bedrooms`
   - `status_idx` on `status`
   - `type_idx` on `type`

2. **Composite indexes** for common query combinations:
   - `location_idx` on `(city, state)` - Optimizes location-based searches
   - `property_type_bedrooms_idx` on `(type, bedrooms)` - Optimizes property filtering

### Field Type Improvements

We've also improved the field types by:

- Using `varchar` with specific length limits instead of `text` for better indexing performance
- Setting appropriate length constraints for each field

### Timestamp Fields

All tables now have standardized timestamp fields:

- `createdAt` - Automatically set to the current timestamp when a record is created
- `updatedAt` - Automatically updated to the current timestamp whenever a record is modified

These fields are managed through:

1. Default values in the schema for `createdAt`
2. PostgreSQL triggers for automatically updating `updatedAt`

### Benefits

These improvements provide:

- Faster property searches by location
- Better performance for filtering properties
- Optimized query execution for common search patterns
- Improved overall database performance
- Automatic tracking of record creation and modification times

## How to Apply These Changes

The schema changes have been implemented using Drizzle ORM. To apply these changes to your database:

1. Generate the migration files:

   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

2. Apply the migrations to your database:

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. Verify the changes using Drizzle Studio:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- The added indexes will improve query performance but may slightly impact write performance
- For very large datasets, consider adding additional optimizations like:
  - Partitioning by location or property type
  - Using GIN indexes for full-text search on description fields
  - Implementing caching for frequently accessed property listings
