# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Property Portal application.

## Image Optimization with Next.js Image Component

We've replaced standard HTML `<img>` tags with Next.js's `Image` component to improve performance and user experience.

### Benefits

- **Automatic Image Optimization**: Images are automatically optimized and served in modern formats like WebP when supported by the browser.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time.
- **Prevents Layout Shifts**: By requiring dimensions or using the `fill` property with aspect ratio containers, the Image component prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically generates and serves appropriately sized images for different devices using the `sizes` attribute.
- **Image CDN Support**: Works seamlessly with image CDNs for even better performance.

### Implementation

We've implemented the Next.js Image component in the following locations:

1. **Property Detail Page**: The main property image uses the `fill` property with an aspect ratio container.
2. **Property List Component**: Each property card image uses the `fill` property with an aspect ratio container.

### Example Usage

```jsx
<div className="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 relative">
  <Image
    src={imageUrl}
    alt={imageAlt}
    fill
    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
    className="object-cover"
    style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}
  />
</div>
```

### Configuration

We've configured Next.js to allow images from external domains in `next.config.js`:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    domains: ['placehold.co'], // Add any external domains you're loading images from
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '**',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Additional Performance Optimizations

### CSS Optimization

- **Tailwind CSS**: We use Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS to eliminate unused CSS in production.
- **CSS Optimization**: We've enabled experimental CSS optimization in Next.js.

### JavaScript Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically code-splits your application, loading only the JavaScript needed for each page.
- **Package Optimization**: We've enabled optimized package imports for frequently used components.

### Server Components

- **React Server Components**: We use React Server Components where appropriate to reduce client-side JavaScript.
- **Streaming with Suspense**: We implement streaming with Suspense to improve perceived performance.

### Caching and Revalidation

- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: For pages that don't need real-time data, we use ISR to serve static pages while updating them in the background.
- **Cache-Control Headers**: We set appropriate cache headers for static assets.

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Use Server Components** for data fetching and static content.
2. **Implement proper loading states** with Suspense boundaries.
3. **Optimize third-party scripts** by loading them only when needed.
4. **Minimize unused JavaScript** by being mindful of imports.
5. **Use the Image component** for all images, especially those from external sources.
6. **Implement proper error boundaries** to prevent the entire application from crashing.
7. **Monitor performance** using tools like Lighthouse and Next.js Analytics.
