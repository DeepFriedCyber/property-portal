# Security Hardening Summary

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Rate Limiting

- Created a custom rate limiting implementation in `lib/rate-limit.ts`
- Applied rate limiting to critical API endpoints:
  - Search API: 20 requests per minute
  - Upload API: 5 requests per minute
- Added proper error handling and response headers for rate-limited requests

### 2. Security Headers

- Implemented middleware in `middleware.ts` to add security headers to all responses:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Permissions-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Referrer-Policy

### 3. Environment Variables

- Updated `.env.example` to include all required environment variables:
  - Added `OLLAMA_API_KEY` for LLM access
  - Added `OLLAMA_MODEL` for model configuration
  - Documented `POOL_SIZE` for database connection pooling

### 4. Security Documentation

- Created comprehensive security documentation in `docs/security.md`
- Added security checking script in `scripts/security-check.js`
- Added `security:check` npm script to package.json

### 5. API Hardening

- Improved error handling in API routes
- Added proper authentication checks
- Implemented caching headers for better performance and security

## Future Recommendations

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis-based implementation for production
2. **API Key Authentication**: Add API key authentication for external service access
3. **Request Signing**: Implement request signing for sensitive operations
4. **Security Scanning**: Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
5. **IP Blocking**: Implement IP-based blocking for repeated abuse attempts
6. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging for security events
7. **Regular Dependency Updates**: Establish a process for regular dependency updates and security patches

## Testing

To verify the security measures:

1. Run the security check script:
   ```
   npm run security:check
   ```

2. Test rate limiting by making multiple rapid requests to the API endpoints

3. Verify security headers using browser developer tools or a security scanning tool
