# Property Detail Page

This directory contains the consolidated implementation of the property detail page.

## Route Structure

The property detail page is accessible at:

```
/properties/[id]
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a modular approach with separate components:

1. **page.tsx** - Main page component with:

   - Static generation capability
   - SEO metadata
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

2. **PropertyDetailContent.tsx** - Client component for displaying property details:

   - Image gallery
   - Property information
   - Map integration
   - Property attributes (council tax, EPC rating, tenure)

3. **NearbyProperties.tsx** - Server component for fetching and displaying nearby properties

## Features

- ✅ Server-rendered with static generation option
- ✅ Fetches property by ID
- ✅ Displays: image, title, location, price, description, council tax, EPC, tenure
- ✅ Shows map with lat/lng
- ✅ Shows nearby amenities
- ✅ Shows nearby properties
- ✅ Loading states with skeletons
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ SEO optimization
- ✅ Dark mode support

## Redirects

A redirect has been set up from the old route (`/[id]`) to the new route (`/properties/[id]`).

## Notes on Consolidation

This implementation consolidates three previous implementations:

1. The original implementation at `/property/[id]`
2. The implementation at `/properties/[id]`
3. The implementation at `/[id]` (route group)

The best features from each implementation were preserved:

- Modular structure from the route group implementation
- SEO metadata from both existing implementations
- Additional property details from the original implementation
- Loading states and error handling from both existing implementations
- Static generation capability from the original implementation
